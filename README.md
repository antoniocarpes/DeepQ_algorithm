# DeepQ_algorithm
Deep Q-Learning Algorithm for Reinforcement Learning on CartPole Environment. This repository contains code for implementing a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm. The task involves training an autonomous agent to balance a pole on a cart using the 'CartPole-v1' environment from the gym library in Python.
